                                    &nbsp;Whenever you post a new matrimonial profile or you modify certain information

                                    Shaadi&nbsp; Bandhan.com. During the screening process, only your essential 
                                    information is displayed. Once the screening process is completed (usually 
                                    within 24 hours) your profile will be completely visible to everybody. If any 
                                    modifications are required then you will be informed immediately by email. 
                                    Profiles are screened to ensure that they follow the terms of use / service 
                                    agreement of  Vivaah.com and to protect your privacy. So if you have

                &nbsp;*&nbsp;Add your Partner Profile. If you do not have a Partner Profile, others 
                viewing your profile will not know what kind of partner you are looking for. So, 
                specify the qualities that you are looking for in your mate. Don&#39;t be 
                unnecessarily restrictive in your choices. Make multiple selections within a 
                category, if need be. Also, if you are logged in, every time you use Smart 
                Search, you have an option of saving the various search criteria as your Partner 
                Profile. Thus, you need not create your Partner Profile separately. Of course, 
                you can modify it any time later. Read Partner profile tips.<br />

                <br />
                We have added a new feature called the &#39;Activity Factor&#39; on every profile.
                <br />
                Activity Factor indicates the chances of your getting a response if you express 
                interest in a member. This is calculated based on the member&#39;s past response 
                pattern - ie, of responding to open interests by either accepting or declining.
                <br />
                Keeping your Activity Factor as high as 100% is really very simple- promptly 
                respond to every single interest that you receive.<br />
