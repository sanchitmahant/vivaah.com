                interest in Shikha&#39;s profile in May 2011 along with my phone number and email 
                id. She accepted my interest. As I was not having my pictures on shaadi.com she 
                mailed me to send some pictures. Shikha and her family liked my pictures and 
                decided to proceed further. For this, Shikha&#39;s mother talked to me on phone and 
                asked more about me, my education, my family etc. After that I talked to Shikha 
                on phone for the first time and we liked the conversation. My family invited 
                Shikha and her family for a meeting to proceed further. Both the families liked 
                each other. Then we started to have long conversation on phone and some time 
                live on skype and soon felt a connection between us. So, we decided to meet each 
                other. Then, I came to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in June 2011 and we met for the first time in 
                the presence of our parents. Since,then there was no looking back and we finally 
                got married in July 2011. Thanks Shaadi.com for making me to meet the love of my 
                life, this was like a key to our relationship without this it was not possible 
                at all. Thank you Shaadi

                Shaadi.com Team, Its a New Year, a time to celebrate LIFE with friends &amp; family 
                around us, a time to leave behind the past &amp; look ahead. A time to wish each one 
                the best for the months &amp; year ahead. So, what better time than NOW to write in 
                and say &quot;THANK YOU DEAR SHAADI TEAM&quot; from both of us. Every time I read success 
                stories on shaadi I wondered if ever I would have my day, so finally here I am 
                today as I write this along with Rahul. Before we go any further we both thought 
                of sharing with you (and other members of the site) some details of how we met, 
                till today... Its really hard to pen down so many memories &amp; wonderful moments 
                in one go.. We met each other on 2-July-10. After getting to know one another 
                via emails, we realised that we had so much in common... it took us no time at 
                all to become BEST FRIENDS.... Rahul was in Mumbai &amp; Roma in Pune. We both 
                believe that any relationship needs HONESTY, DEDICATION and TRUST: qualities 
                which we had found in one another. In Pune we met with Rahul&#39;s mother and felt 
                that we were made for each other. Then came the family part and we decided to go 
                the traditional way. My parents also met and they readily agreed . After that, 
                we decided to get engaged, and so we got engaged on 21st August 2010. We got 
                married on 15th December 2010. It was only because of shaadi.com that I was able 
                to meet him. Me and Rahul, both wish to thank the shaadi.com team for helping us 
                in meeting each other. We wish a very big success to the shaadi.com team. I have 
                already recommended the website to all my friends and would recommend it to many 
                more. You guys are doing a great job and I wish that you continue to do so. Once 
                again thanks a lot from both of us for helping us in changing our lives. Thanks 
                a lot Shaadi.com for making our dream come true &amp; for bringing us together. Roma

mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">One fine day while browsing through millions 
                of profile in Shaadi the sweet face of Shreyoshi conquered my imagination. I 
                wasted barely few seconds in sending her my proposal. Her activity factor was 
                not high and I had little hope of hearing back from her. So, I was elated when 
                she accepted my proposal the very next day and thus our love story was born. 
                Initially it was the messaging through Shaadi.com, then gmail chatting and 
                emailing and then on her birthday I called her up after getting her number from 
                Shaadi.com. Till this it took about a month and then we were hit by cupid&#39;s 
                arrow and we were hit hard. When we opened our Shaadi profile we didn&#39;t have 
                plans of immediate marriage but we fell in love and decided to tie the knot 
                soon. We solemnized our marriage on the 21st of January 2011. We are all 
                pleasantly surprised and happy by this unexpected turn in our lives for good. 
                Thank you Shaadi                 <span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
