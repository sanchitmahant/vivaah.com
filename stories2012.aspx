                saw Achla&#39;s profile and I liked everything about her written and posted there, I 
                was getting a feeling of I WISH she accepts my request. Thanks to almighty, she 
                did and we started communicating through Shaadi.com chat, we developed a unique 
                bond while we chatted, I found her a very like minded and down to earth girl, 
                with a rare and charming blend of modern and traditional values. After we 
                communicated enough and with our parents blessing, we met in 
                <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
                once where we said yes to each other. I got engaged to Achla on 26th September 
                and looking forward eagerly for marriage, most probably on 15th Feb 2013. I am 
                and I will be thankful to Shaadi.com my entire life for blessing me with such a 
                beautiful girl and human being...Thanks Shaadi

                <st1:city

                arranged marriage set-up where our parents talked first and we met for the first 
                time in their presence. I stay in st1:city w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;<st1:place
 w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> and she was working on Pune when we first met. We 
                immediately felt a connection between us during the first meeting itself. We had 
                similar likes and dislikes and we felt really comfortable in each others 
                company. We met the very second day without our parents and chatted away for 
                four hours at a stretch. I knew the very moment that I have found my soulmate 
                and so did she. Since then, there was no looking back and we got engaged just 5 
                days from our first meeting. We are getting married on November 24, 2012. Thanks
