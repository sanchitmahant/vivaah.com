                Bandhan.com Matrimonials?</strong><br />
                <br />
&nbsp;The eMatchmaker™ is a sophisticated proprietary application developed specially for 
                 Vivaah.com members to ensure a higher degree of matrimonial success by matching 
                matrimonial profiles with a high degree of potential compatibility. Read how 
                eMatchmaker™ works.<br />
                <br />
                <strong style="color: #990000">6. How does eMatchmaker™ match my profile with other members&#39; profiles?</strong><br />
                <br />
&nbsp;To illustrate how eMatchmaker™ works lets see an example:<br />
&nbsp;Geeta is a 22 year old Hindu working girl, slim and fair. She is looking for a 25 year old 
                Hindu boy, working as a computer professional in the USA.<br />
                Sunil is 25 year old, Hindu, and a computer professional in USA. He is looking 
                for a 22 year old Hindu working girl who is slim and fair.<br />
                Thus, there is potential compatibility between Geeta and Sunil i.e. a two-way 
                Match has occurred!The eMatchmaker™ works automatically once you have set up 
                your profile and partner profile.For the eMatchmaker™ service to work 
                effectively, you must include as many details as possible in your personal 
                profile and also specify a partner profile.

               <strong style="color: #990000"> 7. How can I see matrimonial profiles matched by 
                Matchmake?</strong>
                <br />
                Login to your My Shaadi panel. Under &quot; Your Profile Statistics&quot; you will find 
                the Matchmake link. Click on the same will show you Matched profiles.<br />
                <br />
                <strong style="color: #990000">8. Why am I not getting many messages and/or matches?</strong><br />
                <br />
&nbsp;There can be many reasons why you are not receiving many responses. It is possible that 
                your Personal Matrimonials Profile does not match the member&#39;s matrimonial 
                requirements specified in his/her Partner Profile. Also, perhaps the member may 
                be more interested in other partners at this time. It is also a good idea to 
                check what the member is looking for in his/her partner, before expressing 
                interest in the member. Also, don&#39;t forget to fill in more information about 
                yourself before you express interest. It encourages people to accept your 
                interests expressed.<br />
                <br />
               <strong style="color: #990000"> 9. Why am I receiving messages and/or matches from members whose profiles don&#39;t 
                match my preferences?</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The most likely reason could be that the partner profile that you have created 
                is too vague or is not specific. To receive more suitable matches and contacts 
                make your partner profile more specific to your preferences.<br />
                <br />
               <strong style="color: #990000"> 10. Can I see any statistics about my matrimonial profile?</strong><br />
                Yes. After you login to your My Shaadi panel, click on the &quot;View Profile Stats&quot; 
                link. On this page you will see a list of statistics in the &quot;My Profile 
                Statistics&quot; section. You can see statistics like how many people viewed your 
                profile, your Favorite profiles, Members whose requirements you meet, Members
