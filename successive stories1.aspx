                Big Thanks to  Vivaah.com for making this website and providing the 
                service which is instrumental in creating in matches like ours. I created my 
                Profile in Feb 2012 and received Suman&#39;s interest in the same month. Her brother 
                contacted my brother and we shared contact details with each other. We started 
                Chatting and talking over the phone to get better understanding of each other. 
                After about a month we agreed to meet each other personally. Suman flew down to <st1:place w:st="on">
                                <st1:city
 w:st="on">melbourne</st1:City></st1:place> with her brother and all of us met at her brother&#39;s 
                friends place. With the blessing of elders we decided to spend our lives 
                together&nbsp;.I guess she was the one and only girl for me on  Vivaah.com, 
                Initially it all started with a typical way of sending the interest.. Then I 
                took a paid membership. Which enabled me to find Sonu&#39;s phone numbers and I 
                could also email her. In a few days we spoke to each other, got to know each&nbsp; 
                other better. Later both the families met and in 2 months we got engaged and in 
                the next 2 months we got Married.. I really appreciate what Shaadi Bhandhan.com 
                did for me. The least i could expect was to find my soulmate from a matrimony 
                website, initially I was hesitant to post my profile with pictures and writing 
                profiles and all that&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff.. but all those efforts paid up in the best 
                possible way.. Thanks  Vivaah.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

                &quot;Someone somewhere is made for everyone&quot; With God&#39;s grace and Shaadi&#39;s team help 
                I met my soulmate, Ajaypal . My parents had been looking for a suitable match 
                for me. I thought of registering on matrimonial site. Ajaypal expressed interest 
                in my profile. I accepted his interest and then my mother started conversation 
                with him. After few days, we did emails and then started talking on phone. I 
                feel am talking to him from ages. We first met on 13th May 2012 with both side 
                families and got committed the same day. We got married on 11th Aug 2012 and 
                finally tied in a knot on 26th Sept 2012. We both are living happily together. 
                This all comes possible with Vivaah.com &#39;s team help. I really appreciate 
                for all their frequent services. Thanks to all. </td>
