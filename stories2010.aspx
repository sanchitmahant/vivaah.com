                found my partner through this matrimony site,which turned out to be heaven for 
                us. Initially I liked his profile and expressed interest to Amish. He responded 
                positively and then we started chatting over the net and then later we have 
                telephonic conversations, In this way we started getting to know each other. I 
                can say that I started liking him even before I met him in person.We 
                communicated for a few months and then later when we meet each other it did not 
                take much time for us to say YES to each other. Though this is an arranged 
                marriage I felt that I knew Amish from a quiet long time and ours is more of a 
                Love Marriage kinda. :) Thanks for helping me find my Dream Man. Amish and I 
                would like to thank Shaadi.com for this platform where we found our soulmate. 
                Cheers to Shaadi.com !!! Keep up this great service !!! In Love -Amish &amp; Dipti<br

                over emails. Our parents talked to each other matched Kundli and Horoscope. We 
                as well interacted over fone and chat when things were getting towards 
                settlement. I met her for the first time in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City> with her family and that&#39;s how all got settled. We 
                got engaged on Dec 12, 2009 at <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> and will get married on Feb 15, 2009. I never had

                service and have as well recommended many to use shaadi.com. I found the website
